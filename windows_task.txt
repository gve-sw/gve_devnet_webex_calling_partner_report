# https://www.jcchouinard.com/python-automation-using-task-scheduler/

# Steps:
# 1.) Search for 'Task Scheduler'
# 2.) Go to Actions > Create Task...
# 3.) Provide a name and description
# 4.) Run `pwd` and `where python` to get absolute paths to script files and python binary
# 4.) Create a New Action > provide the path to python binary, add the path to the python script as an argument > Save
# 5.) Set the trigger (day, frequency, time, etc.)

# NOTE: it's recommened to run the task manually through Windows Scheduler first to ensure it works. Check back for errors if no results appear after the scheduled time.
